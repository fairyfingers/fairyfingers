## Hi !
I'm a web developer specialized in the JavaScript ecosystem. 👨‍💻 I love to craft high-quality software through meticulous testing and effective coding practices.


Here are the services I have to offer :

🎨 **Frontend Development :** Creating visually engaging and responsive frontend interfaces using Angular

🛠️ **Backend Development :** Designing and developing robust backend systems using Node.js with Express or NestJS

💾 **Database Integration :** Proficiency in working with SQL and MongoDB, designing schemas, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity

🌐 **RESTful API Design :** Crafting clean and efficient RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between frontend and backend

🧪 **Test-Driven-Development :** Using TDD to be guided in the development process by iteratively building and refining features

📑 **Version Control and Collaboration :** Collaborating effectively with Git, managing code changes and maintaining organized workflows


I'm also comfortable using different languages and frameworks such as :
· TypeScript
· JavaScript
· NestJS
· MongoDB
· PostgreSQL
· Angular
· And some other skills that are detailed above.

Both my scholarship and my career have taught me to be a team player. However I’m totally capable of working on my own if necessary.

I’d be happy to exchange about your future projects!
Feel free to send me a message.
